# Chau Dinh

This is my homepage where I update what I've done recently (now, they are side projects) and some basic information. 

## What we will cover?
* Using ReactJS for building a portfolio -  with a standard cli create-react-app
* Using `antd` - ant design: an enterprise designing UI system for web application. It is actually built by a set of React components.
* Attaching a resume
* Listing courses, and books that I've taken.
